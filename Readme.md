Currency Converter
==================

lightweight Currency Converter in Vanilla Javascript.

Installation
------------
1. Open your console
2. type `open index.html`

Reasoning
------------
1. Did not use SCSS due to having to use shadow DOM.
2. Heavy sanitation is not needed due to having no database or private information.
3. fetch is used due to lacking JQuery AJAX.
4. Node.js is unavailable along with CDNs so polyfills/SCSS cannot be used.

Suggestions
------------
1. Remove component-based architecture unless using React/Angular so stylesheets can be utilized.

Assignment suggestions
----------------------
1. More clarity and guidelines on what I should be doing
2. Information on available technologies and unavailable ones.

Thank you!
